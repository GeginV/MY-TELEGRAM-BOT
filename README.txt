My First Bot Project

intro:
This a bot for Telegram that allows you to convert Etherium, Bitcoin, Dollar in different quantities. 
While making it, I played around a bit with creating virtual inviroment specifically for this project (it doesn't make much difference though).
I also included the archived version of the entire project just in case.

how to find:
@PythonVtestbot

avaliable commands:
1. /start, /help - display introductory message describing how to work with the bot
2. /values - display avaliable currencies
3. <from>  <to>  <how much> - this it the format of currency input command

known issues:
1. When converting 1 Dollar to Bitcoin the bot gets extremely mathematical with it's output in order to save space
2. For mobile input convinience had to make currency vocabulary a bit 'case-resistant'. It shows when /values is displayed.

bonus:
